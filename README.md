# PESEditor

Option File Editor for PES6. Originally created by Compulsion, with CSV import added and source code released by Juce.

Various enhancements to functionality including:

- CSV Export and Import includes all player attributes and settings except for call name
- CSV Export headers rearranged to more closely match the in-game editor
- Ability to set random Growth Type/Specific Growth Type by entering "Random" into the column for the CSV import
- Importing players by ID, allowing an import of only certain players
- Option to import players but not update the club teams, national teams and classic teams
